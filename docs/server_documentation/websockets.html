            Websockets permits CyFire to allow users to be able to interact with each other
            through a websocket server. This package consists of configuration class, as well
            as a server class. In order to be used by the frontend, the server endpoint
            that needs to be used it /websockets/{net_id}, where the net_id is the net_id that
            the user logged in is trying to privately message.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is currently set up so that when a person goes to message another user, it will
            automatically append a "@{receiver_net_id}" to the start of the message. The reason
            for this is somewhat lazy, as this is a sort of jank solution to a bigger problem.
            That being, there is only technically one "socket", but if all messages sent
            between users are "private" "@'ed" messages, then it won't be noticed.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the future I hope to better understand websockets so I can implement
            one-on-one chatrooms in a much more elegant solution.
