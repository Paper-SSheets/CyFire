        <p>
            The "email" package consists of both a configuration class as well as a rest controller.
            The configuration class sets up the backend content required for sending emails. I chose to
            use Gmail and Spring. The host, port, username, and password, can be found in the
            application.properties file. Without these set it, emails <b>can not be sent.</b>

        </p>
        <p>
            The controller takes care of everything else, and needs only to be called by the
            front-end by using 'server_name'/send_code, with the same parameters <b>just used</b>
            to register the user. This should be as simple as saving the parameters used in the
            registration page, and clicking a button that says something like "Send Code".
        </p>
        <p>
            In the future, this feature could also be used for purposes outside of verification.
            Such examples include (@342 on Piazza) resetting your password, updating your gender,
            updating your age (although, I would like to implement birthdays so this would be done
            automatically), etc.!
