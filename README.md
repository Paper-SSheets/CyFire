# CyFire
A dating app for Iowa State students. I was the sole worker on backend. Other contributers were Jared Weiland and Andrew Marek. Will update with links to them. While we did not finish the project, it is something I desire to look at in the future and get working fully. I have a lack of understanding on how frontend works and want to learn more about it.
