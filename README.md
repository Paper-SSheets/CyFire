# CyFire
A mobile dating application for Iowa State students built with Spring Boot. I was the sole worker on backend. Other contributers were [Jared Weiland](https://github.com/jbweiland) and [Andrew Marek](https://github.com/andmarek). Will update with links to them. While we did not finish the project, it is something I desire to look at in the future and get working fully. I have a lack of understanding on how frontend works and want to learn more about it.
